Here, we describe our recommendations for aspects to consider when comparing languages in Objected Oriented principles.

* Access Control
* Inheritance (public, protected, private, multiple inheritance, etc.)
* Standard containers/library abstractions
* Exception Handling
* Design patterns and how they differ in implementations. For example, the policy design pattern can use multiple inheritance to be implemented in cpp, but cannot in Java. Other common design patterns include Factory, Singleton, Observer, etc.
* Management of Memory (manual, automatic/garbage collection, etc.)
* Encapsulation and how it handled/mechanisms that support/enforce it
* Generics/templates, etc. 
* Operator overloading
* Portability of code
* Design goals
