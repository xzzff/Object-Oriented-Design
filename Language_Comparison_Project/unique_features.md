# Cpp
Some very unique features of Cpp include:
* Operator overloading
* Multiple inheritance
* Ability to write inline assembly (MMX, SSE, etc.)
  For example to use specialized processor instructions such as hardware-accelerated AES encryption rounds
* Performance
* RAII/deterministic finalization
  * Garbage collection is not *just as good* when dealing with a scarce, shared resource
* Unfettered access to OS APIs
* Use of Turing-complete preprocessor
* Templates and template metaprogramming
* Absolute control over memory layout, alignment, and access when you need it the most.
* Automatic type deduction (`decltype`)

# Java
Some unique features of Java include:
* The strength of Java is the JVM and the plentiful number of open source libraries available. 
  * So Java programs can be run on any platform (Linux, Windows, Mac)
* Java is pure OOP whereas Cpp is a mix of OOP and procedural.
* Security
  * No pointers, yet secure memory management still
* Lambda expressions
* Method Captures
* Streams
